{"qid": "q1", "query": "What dataset was introduced in the paper, how many games does it contain, and what annotations were added?", "gold_answer": "We introduce ChessBench, a large-scale benchmark dataset for chess, consisting of 530M board states (from 10M games on lichess.org) annotated via Stockfish 16 with state-values and best-action, as well as 15B action-values for all legal actions in each board state (corresponding to roughly 8864 days of unparallelized Stockfish evaluation time).", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess Bench with Stockfish Paper"]}
{"qid": "q2", "query": "What model size was used, what performance level did it achieve, and without what key component?", "gold_answer": "We train transformers of up to 270M parameters to predict action-values via supervised learning. The largest models generalize well to novel boards, enable play at grandmaster level (Lichess blitz Elo of 2895) against humans, and solve chess puzzles with difficulty ratings up to a Lichess Puzzle Elo of 2867 – without using explicit search at test time.", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess Bench with Stockfish Paper"]}
{"qid": "q3", "query": "What was the overlap between the training set and test set boards, and why was this overlap not removed?", "gold_answer": "Since there is only a small number of early-game board states and players often play popular openings, 14.7% of boards in this i.i.d. test are also in the training set. We deliberately chose not remove them, to not introduce a distributional shift and skew test set metrics.", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess Bench with Stockfish Paper"]}
{"qid": "q4", "query": "What was the size of the largest training dataset in terms of action-value estimates, and how much Stockfish evaluation time did this correspond to?", "gold_answer": "For our largest training dataset, based on 10M games, we thus obtain 15.3B action-value estimates (or ≈ 530M state-value estimates and oracle best-actions; cf.

{"qid": "q5", "query": "What were the main contributions of the ChessBench paper?", "gold_answer": "Our main contributions are: • We introduce ChessBench, a large-scale benchmark dataset for chess, consisting of 530M board states (from 10M games on lichess.org) annotated via Stockfish 16 with state-values and best-action, as well as 15B action-values for all legal actions in each board state (corresponding to roughly 8864 days of unparallelized Stockfish evaluation time). • We train transformers of up to 270M parameters to predict action-values via supervised learning. The largest models generalize well to novel boards, enable play at grandmaster level (Lichess blitz Elo of 2895) against humans, and solve chess puzzles with dificulty ratings up to a Lichess Puzzle Elo of 2867 – without using explicit search at test time. • We perform extensive ablations, including model- and dataset size, network architecture, action-value vs. state-value vs. behavioral cloning, and various hyper-parameters. • We open source our ChessBench dataset, our model weights, and all training and evaluation code at https://github.com/google-deepmind/searchless_chess, and provide a series of benchmark results through our models, ablations, and comparisons with Stockfish 16, Leela Chess Zero, and AlphaZero, and their searchless policy/value networks.", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess Bench with Stockfish Paper"]}
{"qid": "q6", "query": "What two sources of information do humans use in decision-making, and what does ChessGPT aim to integrate?", "gold_answer": "When solving decision-making tasks, humans typically depend on information from two key sources: (1) Historical policy data, which provides interaction replay from the environment, and (2) Analytical insights in natural language form, exposing the invaluable thought process or strategic considerations. ... we propose ChessGPT, a GPT model bridging policy learning and language modeling by integrating data from these two sources in Chess games.", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess GPT Paper"]}
{"qid": "q7", "query": "What are the four categories of datasets introduced for ChessGPT?", "gold_answer": "Our dataset can be mainly divided into four categories: (1) The Game dataset, encompassing online chess match replay data involving worldwide human players and chess engines of varying skill levels. (2) The Language dataset, principally recording chess-associated knowledge, analyses, discussions, and news in the form of natural language (3) The Mixed Game-Language dataset, incorporating both game data and human natural language elements (such as game analysis or comments) in alignment. (4) The instruction-tuning and conversation dataset, consisting of instruction data and conversation data related to chess.", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess GPT Paper"]}
{"qid": "q8", "query": "What is the size of the Lichess dataset collected, and what additional datasets were added to diversify the data?", "gold_answer": "Lichess dataset We collect five months of online game data from the Lichess database [30], culminating in a total of 17.5 million game replay records for online game players. ... To diversify our game dataset with more skilled matches, we also incorporated an additional 440,000 game records from 245 professional chess players. ... Considering this, we additionally incorporate the Computer Chess Rating Lists (CCRL) [10], which is a dataset of chess games played by computer chess engines. The CCRL dataset comprises a considerable collection of chess games, specifically 3 million, all of which are played by computer chess engines and stored in PGN format.", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess GPT Paper"]}
{"qid": "q9", "query": "What evaluation framework was designed for ChessGPT models, and what are the three perspectives of evaluation?", "gold_answer": "Evaluations. We design an extensive set of tasks to evaluate our models’ abilities from three distinct perspectives: modeling ability, to gauge the model’s proficiency in tracking game state; value judgement ability, measuring the model’s capacity for value assessment and chess knowledge; and policy ability, to test the model’s capability in decision-making.", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess GPT Paper"]}
{"qid": "q10", "query": "What tasks were used in Big-bench’s State Tracking in Chess evaluation, and what were ChessGPT’s performance results compared to baselines?", "gold_answer": "We utilized Big-bench’s State Tracking in Chess task [49, 54] to evaluate language models’ ability to track the state of chess games encoded in UCI notation. ...

{"qid": "q11", "query": "What is Maia-2, and what novel contribution does it introduce?", "gold_answer": "We contribute a unified modeling approach for human-AI alignment in chess that coherently captures human style across different skill levels and directly captures how people improve. Since our model builds directly on original Maia, we call it Maia-2. Maia-2 consists of a standard residual network tower that processes chess positions into features, and our novel contribution of a skill-aware attention module with channel-wise patching.", "gold_source_ids": ["Maia-2 Paper"]}
{"qid": "q12", "query": "What inputs does Maia-2 require compared to previous models, and what advantage does this provide?", "gold_answer": "Unlike previous models, Maia-2 only requires the current board position as input (as opposed to six), which dramatically reduces training time and increases flexibility (e.g. for applying the model in non-game contexts where there may be no 6-board history).", "gold_source_ids": ["Maia-2 Paper"]}
{"qid": "q13", "query": "What were the accuracy improvements in move prediction and perplexity achieved by Maia-2 compared to original Maia?", "gold_answer": "Maia-2 emerges as the most accurate human move predictor by far, surpassing original Maia by almost 2 full percentage points. ...
